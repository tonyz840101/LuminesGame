# LuminesGame
A mini game of Lumines, made at 2017.07.
There are red and white cubes in Lumines. There will be four cubes of random color stack in a squre dropping down from top, and player will put together four same-color cubes to clear them by rotating and moving them left or right. Once the cube stacks to the bottom or cubes, it will stay there. Try to get cubes cleared as much as possible.

The visul effects are based on this video:

Using html canvas to animate the game and visual effects frame by frame.

Why I made this game:
  A practice of "prototype" in javascript.
  It's also a game on my old Sony Ericsson phone I used to kill time with.

Game play:
  Space: Start the game and restart after playing.
  W/A/S/D or Arrow key: Move, Rotate, and speed Down the cube.
  P: pause.
